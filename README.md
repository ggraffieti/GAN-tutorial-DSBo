#  From art to deep fakes: an introduction to Generative Adversarial Networks.

To run the code:

- Install all the requirements, install jupyter, open a terminal and type `jupyter notebook`.
- The jupyter web interface should be reachable from `localhost:8888`.
- Navigate to the `vanilla_gan_pytorch.ipynb` file, and open it from the browser.
- Run all the section and see the results (it may take a while if you don't have a GPU). 

The code is inspired by the amazing work by Diego Gomez Mosquera [article](https://medium.com/ai-society/gans-from-scratch-1-a-deep-introduction-with-code-in-pytorch-and-tensorflow-cb03cdcdba0f) [code](https://github.com/diegoalejogm/gans)
